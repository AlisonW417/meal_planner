NEXT TIME: finish style video?
Priorities:
- double check rails controller code for create
- add ingredients to all seed data (check on null result in grocery list)
- add basic data validation to rails api, add error messages for validations?
- research how to handle form creation with JS
- continue to refactor and clean up code


Hopes:
- change ingredient display (allow sorting)
- add status and error handling to rails controllers? (video 7, 16:00 min mark)

Don't Forget To:
- update routes in rails api (only the routes being used)
- write README
- write blog post
- record video walkthrough
