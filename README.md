NEXT TIME: start at video 9
Priorities:
- update form to allow for additional ingredients and double check rails controller code for create
- set limit for select meal button to 7 times(1 week of meals)
- consider refactoring make meals populate as dialy meal cards rather than current table layout -- or change table direction? need to denote day of the week.
- add ingredients to all seed data (check on null result in grocery list)
- meal and ingredient form fields on submit
- refactor meal displays to be more abstract? create separate classes for categories? THINK DRY
- add basic data validation to rails api
- research how to handle form creation with JS

Hopes:
- change ingredient display (allow sorting)
- add status and error handling to rails controllers? (video 7, 16:00 min mark)

Don't Forget To:
- update routes in rails api (only the routes being used)
- remove appContainer and dailyMealPlan classes?
- write README
- record coding session
- write blog post
- record video walkthrough
